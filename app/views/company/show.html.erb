    <h2>The story of Brandit to date…</h2>

    <p>What a journey it has been, it all started in 2001 when Christian Hawley the founder was taking a year out to travel the world, he embarked on identifying the prospect of setting up one of the UK’s best interior stores.</p>

    <p>It was in Australia he found such inspiration and on his return to England he decided to visit some of the world’s best furniture fairs from Milan to Paris to source innovative furniture and lighting products.</p>

    <p>The first shop was established in 2002 in Southampton and quickly established itself as a firm favourite with design buyers.</p>

    <p>brand.it now operates a highly successful website with over 15,000 product options and will continue to work hard to bring you the very best interiors available from our worldwide resource of furniture and lighting manufacturers.</p>
